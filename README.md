## Warnings (to read before usage) :

```diff
Due to defaults in the construction of the original .CSV file rendering it unusable (header split between the 1st and 2nd rows),
the actual data used by the dataframe comes from a manually cleaned .CSV file, which can be found in the 'data' folder
of the source code.
